Disclaimer: I'm a n00b. This is the first code I've ever written. I wanted to participate in this challenge to cut my teeth on python development.

I wasn't sure about some conventions, so I went with techniques I've read in my python book. Specifically, I wasn't sure if I should prompt the user for input or use args. I wrote most of these using prompts before I figured out that's kind of a n00b thing.
